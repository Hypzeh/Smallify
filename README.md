# Smallify

This is a WPF application using `Prism` & `Unity`, intended to provide a mini Spotify player for Windows.

## Notes

- Spotify Premium required for media controls
- Smallify is **NOT** a standalone Spotify device, users will need to have an official Spotify device/application on standby
