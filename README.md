## Installation

Download the latest [Smallify release](https://github.com/hypzeh/smallify/releases/latest).

## Usage

Smallify is **NOT** a standalone Spotify device, this means that an official Spotify client will be required for audio playback. Spotify Premium is required for modifying playback state.

Smallify uses the [Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow) for authentication. Connect to a Spotify account through the authentication tab in the settings menu.
